  "OrxDscrptn": "A striking medium-sized antelope with very ling horns. Overall is white in colour with dark brown or black legs, white socks above black hooves, a dark flank stripe and white tail, tipped black. The muzzle tip is white and the dark brown facial markings include a vertical bar that runs through the eye and a patch on the bridge of the nose. In summer the flank stripe and other dark markings of the body are lighter or absent altogether. Both males and females carry almost straight, ringed horns that may reach 70 cm in length. Females usually have thinner and longer horns than males. Sexes are difficult to tell apart except that adult males are heavier set.",
